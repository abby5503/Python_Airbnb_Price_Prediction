# Python_Airbnb_Price_Prediction
Introduction

Background
- Airbnb is a platform to find adventures nearby or in faraway places and access unique homes, experiences, and places around the world. It provides us to share our properties in many types and become the Airbnb host, in other ways, we can also through this platform to find the distinctive place and experience the local style as travelers. In this Notebook, I'm going to explore the 2020 house source data of Airbnb in New York City.

Problem
- Pricing is an essential part of Airbnb business. A clear and meaningful pricing system will benefit the business both from the house owner side and the customer side. In this project, I'm going to predict the daily price for the house/apartment/room on airbnb. Besides, I also did the research on the improvement of prediction after implementing the Foursquare Data. The prediction can be used in the business scene including but not limit to:

  New house price suggestion
  Existed house price scanning
  Market strategy making
  House segmentation
  
There are two different Notebooks in the seperate folder. 
Both of them includes the out source data to increase the features.

One is taking the venues in the neighborhoods into the prediction. (Scrapping from Foursquare)
The other is considering the most popular attractions and the number of subway station near the house listing.
